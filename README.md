If you watch the video it will show you how it should work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nikLsfXdRnM
One small problem is that product uploads in the admin panel isn't working - I suspect something happened when cleaning up code and changing directories of certain files as it worked before. Edit and remove still work so not a big deal. Everything works for the users.
Start of the video is users perspective, end of vid is admins perspective
Sign up works as it should but I did not display it in the video
Upon login it will check the role of the user and direct them to the correct place
I have also disabled the use of adding to cart for admins so that only works for an account with a role of user
Oh and the legacy folder just contains the old code that I used before the redesign
